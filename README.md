# Space Exploration

This was a project from Module 2 (Web Development Basics) of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). It was a static page that showed a hero section with a logo, \<h1> and button. Below was an \<h3> with the text "Terms and conditions apply".

I built onto it, changing the styles and adding two more sections with an \<h3>, button and background image and a footer with additional "buttons" with hover effects. I applied text shadows to the h3's and made the button backgrounds transparent as well as adding hover effects. 

The footer is a flexbox and is responsive with flex-wrap. Background images were changed from being local to linking out to images on the internet (Unsplash and Giphy).
