# Space Exploration

This was a Scrimba project. It was a static page that showed a hero section with a logo, \<h1> and button. Below was an \<h3> with the text "Terms and conditions apply".

I built onto it, changing the styles and adding two more sections with an \<h3>, button and background image and a footer with additional "buttons" with hover effects. I applied text shadows to the h3's and made the button backgrounds transparent as well as adding hover effects. The footer is a flexbox and is responsive with flex-wrap.
